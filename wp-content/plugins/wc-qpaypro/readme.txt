== Description ==

= QPayPro - WooCommerce Payment Gateway =

This is a basic pluging to connect your your woocommerce store with [QPayPro](https://www.qpaypro.com/) payment Gateway. If the transaction is successful the order status will be changed to “processing”. If the payment charge failed the order status will be changed to “cancelled”. If something is wrong with the connection between your server and the QPayProCard server the order status will be changed to “on-hold”. After successful transaction the customer is redirected to the default WP thank you page.
